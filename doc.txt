welcome to doc.txt. here ill show all of the commands used in scamgame

1. CHOICE
CHOICE is one of the most important commands in this whole game. it creates a choice. i.e. do you want to delete this? [y/n]?
its usage is very simple

CHOICE [/C choices] [/N] [/CS] [/T timeout /D choice] [/M text]

parameter list:
   /C    choices       Specifies the list of choices to be created.
                       Default list is "YN".

   /N                  Hides the list of choices in the prompt.
                       The message before the prompt is displayed
                       and the choices are still enabled.

   /CS                 Enables case-sensitive choices to be selected.
                       By default, the utility is case-insensitive.

   /T    timeout       The number of seconds to pause before a default
                       choice is made. Acceptable values are from 0 to
                       9999. If 0 is specified, there will be no pause
                       and the default choice is selected.

   /D    choice        Specifies the default choice after nnnn seconds.
                       Character must be in the set of choices specified
                       by /C option and must also specify nnnn with /T.

   /M    text          Specifies the message to be displayed before
                       the prompt. If not specified, the utility
                       displays only a prompt.


Examples:
   CHOICE /?
   CHOICE /C YNC /M "Press Y for Yes, N for No or C for Cancel."
   CHOICE /T 10 /C ync /CS /D y
   CHOICE /C ab /M "Select a for option 1 and b for option 2."
   CHOICE /C ab /N /M "Select a for option 1 and b for option 2."

2. GOTO
if you snoop at my src, you might see goto. it's basically "if this, then go to that" etc.

GOTO label

  label   Specifies a text string used in the batch program as a label.

You type a label on a line by itself, beginning with a colon.

For example:

goto test
:test

3. echo
echo is the most easiest command. it prints text on the cmd window.
NOTE: @echo off is used for disabling input, this is an example:

NO @ECHO OFF
C:\Users\Maksy\Desktop>echo hello
hello

WITH @ECHO OFF

hello

Notice there's no command executing it.
